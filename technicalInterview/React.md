- ### How Does the virtual DOM in React.js work ?

1. react use the virtual DOM(Document Object Model) to optimize updates and rendering.
2. the virtual DOM is lightweight in memory representation of the actual DOM.
3. when the state of a component changes, react compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only makes changes to the actual DOM where necessary, which is much more efficient than re-rendering the entire page.

- ### How does React.js handle updates and rendering ?

1. when component's state changes, react will re-render that component and its child components to reflict the new state.
2. react use a virtual DOM to optimize updates by only re-rendering the specific parts of the actual DOM that have changes.
3. this helps to improve performance of the app.
