3. it differs from other JS libraries is that it focuses on the view layer of an application.

- ### Advantages of using React.js ?

1. Reusable components.
2. Good performance.
3. strong developer community and support.
4. Can be used on the client and server side.
5. Easy integration with libraries and frameworks.
6. virtual DOM for efficient updates and rendering.

- ### How Does the virtual DOM in React.js work ?

1. react use the virtual DOM(Document Object Model) to optimize updates and rendering.
2. the virtual DOM is lightweight in memory representation of the actual DOM.
3. when the state of a component changes, react compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only makes changes to the actual DOM where necessary, which is much more efficient than re-rendering the entire page.

---

- ### How does React.js handle updates and rendering ?

1. when component's state changes, react will re-render that component and its child components to reflict the new state.
2. react use a virtual DOM to optimize updates by only re-rendering the specific parts of the actual DOM that have changes.
3. this helps to improve performance of the app.

- ### What are the components in react.js and how are they used ?

1. components in react.js are the building blocks of a react app.

2. state can be changed within a component, which will trigger a re-render.
3. props are inouts passed to component from its parent.
4. they are read only and cannot be changed within the component.

- ### what is the component lifecycle in react.js ?

1. componentDidMount : executed after the first render.
2. componentDidUpdate : executed after each update.
3. componentWillUnmount : executed before the compoent is removed from the DOM.

2. used to describe the structure and content of a component.

---

- ### How does server-side rendering work in react.js ?

1. server side rendering involves rendering the initial HTML on the server, rather than in the browser.
2. this can hrlp improve performance especially for slower devices.
